## Apriori Algorithm

Apriori is an algorithm for finding frequent itemsets in a dataset of transactions. A frequent itemset is a set of items that appears frequently in the dataset.

To find frequent itemsets using Apriori, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the input data as a collection of transactions. A transaction is a set of items that have been purchased together. For example, you might have a dataset of grocery store transactions, where each transaction is a set of items that were purchased in a single shopping trip.

2. Define the minimum support threshold for the frequent itemsets you want to find. The support of an itemset is the percentage of transactions in which the itemset appears. For example, if the minimum support is 0.5, an itemset must appear in at least 50% of the transactions to be considered frequent.

3. Count the frequency of each item in the dataset. You can do this by iterating over the transactions and keeping a count of how many times each item appears.

4. Filter the items to keep only those that meet the minimum support threshold. To do this, divide the count of each item by the total number of transactions,


Here is an example of how you might use Apriori to find frequent itemsets in a dataset of grocery store transactions:

Minimum support threshold: 0.5

Transactions:
[milk, bread, eggs]
[milk, bread]
[milk, eggs]
[bread, eggs]

Step 1: Count the frequency of each item in the dataset

Item       Count
milk       3
bread      3
eggs       3

Step 2: Filter the items to keep only those that meet the minimum support threshold

Item       Count
milk       3
bread      3
eggs       3

Step 3: Generate candidate frequent itemsets of size 2 and count their frequency in the dataset

Itemset    Count
[milk, bread]     2
[milk, eggs]      2
[bread, eggs]     2

Step 4: Filter the candidate itemsets to keep only those that meet the minimum support threshold

Itemset    Count
[milk, bread]     2
[milk, eggs]      2
[bread, eggs]     2

Step 5: Generate candidate frequent itemsets of size 3 and count their frequency in the dataset

Itemset            Count
[milk, bread, eggs]     1

Step 6: Filter the candidate itemsets to keep only those that meet the minimum support threshold

Itemset            Count
[milk, bread, eggs]     1

Result: The frequent itemsets are [milk, bread], [milk, eggs], [bread, eggs], and [milk, bread, eggs].
